This subfolder contains graphics files that were converted to Base64 for the main Adventuron file source_code.adv with MENU:IMPORT.

The naming conventions are as follows:

* o- = overlay graphics (e.g. transparent graphics placed on the main graphics. The main one is the check mark for the hubs)
* r- = room graphics
* s- = cutscene graphics
* t- = thing (item) graphics (placed last to help avoid spoilers)
