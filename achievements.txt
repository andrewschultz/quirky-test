The color coding is different for achievements than footnotes or bonus points. There are spoilers for the main game here, but it's assumed you've already been through, if you want to look in here.

* RED ACHIEVEMENTS

** Hi, All I Haul

This suggests looking at your inventory.

More specifically, it suggest looking at your inventory when you have the maximum number of items.

When does that happen? When you've solved all the independent puzzles and none of the dependent ones.

So you need to solve all of East Branch except the Trim Goon, then the Cake Trackers and Shell Fort in West Tiles. Then take inventory.

** More Than Thor, Man

Don't talk to Thor.

** Too Yacky: You, Tacky

This suggests talking to lots of people. In particular, every person you can find, even hostile ones.

The talk_need list has a list of places you need to talk.

First Base (Pro Boor)
Plain Base (Beery Thor)
Plaster Man (W/N) (before getting the master plan)
Malice Chap (W/NE) (before getting chalice map)
Cake Trackers (W/S) (before you TAKE CRACKERS)
Grunters' Hill (W/W) (before setting the hunters' grills)
Yellow Field (W/NW) (before saying FELLOW YIELD)
Trending Booth (E/NE) (before BENDING TRUTH)
Warring Bay (E/E) (before BORING WAY)
Money Fountain (E/W) (any time)
Trim Goon (E/NW) (before GRIM TUNE)

** Get a Major Meta-Gauger

This requires you to perform all the informational meta-verbs acknowledged elsewhere. Diagnostics (INVENTORY, SCORE) don't count. Neither do options.

* ORANGE ACHIEVEMENTS

** Totes Need Notes Teed

The footnote_finding_list list in the source spoils things. However, hopefully there isn't anything too detailed to spoil, since it's mostly about examining.

Ones not found in the flow of the game include

X ME twice
EAST at Burst Face (with note you can't go back)
X PRO BOOR
XYZZY (clued by the big runes)
X TRENDING BOOTH
X PLASTER MAN/MASTER PLAN/POURING RAIN/ROARING PAIN
X MALICE CHAP
X CRACKERS
X HISSING MOUSE
X BOOKSHELF

** Cueing Direct Doing: Correct

No bonus points on one runthrough.

** Player-Can-Pair-Clan Care Plan

TILE PRICKS and PILE TRICKS with the trial pics.

** Reach Out Each Route

Score a point based on an item in each area.

TEST WILES or RIG BOONS in West Tiles.

BEAST RANCH or RIG BOONS in East Branch.

CHEERY TIMES can be done in My House, but it affects the chimes outside.

EYE STAY in My House.

Clever! Nap? Never! (Clap!)

Get all bonus points. Note this gets Reach Out Each Route and will get you Cueing Direct Doing: Correct on the next runthrough, if you haven't got it already.

* YELLOW ACHIEVEMENTS

** Quell-Worrying-Well Querying

TALK THOR, then

ASK 1, ASK 2, etc. to ASK 17.

This is facilitated by the up-arrow key.

** Knowin' Stuff, Stowin' 'Nuff

ASK all three times. This is trickier to track, but again, the up-arrow key makes things go faster.

* GREEN ACHIEVEMENTS (SPEED RUN RELATED)

** So Slick! Slow? Sick!

Don't return to Plain Base until you have the grail.

** Great Style, Straight Guile

Try no dependent puzzles before you're ready. For instance, if you try GRIM TUNE before FLY SCORE or POURING RAIN, that'd cost you the achievement this time through.

** Re-Sight-See? Riiight

Take the minimum moves between locations. So go northeast, then solve things clockwise from north, then up and west, and solve things clockwise from east. Then up to Stealing Hill for the grail.

** Second Revvin' Reckoned? Seven!

Do all seven dependent puzzles in the post-hub area out of order. (Plaster Man, Malice Chap, Gift Shoals, Grunters' Hill, Yellow Field, Trim Goon, Stealing Hill). Note you can solve some non-dependent puzzles first, just not any two that work together.

* BLUE ACHIEVEMENTS (JUMP/WARP RELATED)

** Balk "Why? Walk By!"

Don't use any of the four jump commands.

** Throw Me Mo': Three

Warp three rooms over. There are 14 ways to do this: From a west hub room to East Branch, or an east hub room to West Branch.

** Chump, Joke Jump? Choke

Try to jump back to Stealing Hill after you got the grail.

** Did-Buzzin'-Bid? Dozen

There are twelve from/to combinations for jumps. Try them all.

** Cousin, Draft Dozen-Craft

Perform all twelve jumps without repeating, or walking anywhere.

This is tricky, and I don't want to spoil it, as I think it's a rewarding puzzle!

* PURPLE ACHIEVEMENTS (examine stuff)

** Hi! Beer By Here?

There's implied beer with Thor's picture and with the description. You may also guess where beer might be, and it must be somewhere, given the accomplishment.

(VERB) BEER around Thor.

** Neat-Book-Beat Nook

X SHELF until you are told it's the last one. (There are seventeen books as of the first release.)

==============================================================

People who like to optimize things may wonder how many times through you need. I think the answer is two, but you have to be very careful.

Achievements not affected by walkthrough (can/should be done first so your mind is clear for the second time through)
** Too Yacky: You, Tacky (talk in first base, plain base, W:W/S/N/NE, E:NE/E/W/NW)
** Get a Major Meta-Gauger
** Player-Can-Pair-Clan Care Plan
** Hi! Beer By Here?
** Neat-Book-Beat Nook

Achievements not affected by walkthrough but mutually exclusive:
** More Than Thor, Man (don't talk to Thor at all--do this 2nd time through)
** Quell-Worrying-Well Querying
** Knowin' Stuff, Stowin' 'Nuff (talk to Thor about everything)

Must be done 2nd time but otherwise doesn't affect other achievements:
** Totes Need Notes Teed (details in walkthrough.txt -- the key thing here is remembering to examine stuff before it disappears)

Special order:
** Hi, All I Haul

Bonus point stuff (once through with all, once through with none, no conflicts otherwise):
** Cueing Direct Doing: Correct
** Reach Out Each Route

Mutually exclusive (no THINK, all THINK):
** Great Style, Straight Guile
** Second Revvin' Reckoned? Seven!

Efficiency and warping (can only do one or the other):
* Efficiency / no jumps
** So Slick! Slow? Sick! (get grail without revisiting Thor)
** Re-Sight-See? Riiight (this is not achievable if you use a warp command)
** Balk \"Why? Walk By!"
* Warping / jumps
** Throw Me Mo': Three
** Chump, Joke Jump? Choke
** Did-Buzzin'-Bid? Dozen
** Cousin, Draft Dozen-Craft

So one plan to get things done in two runs (and avoid tricky oversights)

1. be very efficient the first time through. Get all the bonus points. Do not do any commands out of order. Do not visit a spoke more than once. (sweep east hub then west) Get through all the independent achievements. Don't forget to X BEER and X SHELF for one cycle. ASK 0 around Thor to make sure you got everything. TALK everywhere, before scoring a point. While you can ASK or TALK the second time through, there's enough to juggle there that you may miss stuff.

2. the second time through, be sure to get all the footnotes. This requires examining some entities before getting rid of them. (#3 is also tricky as you must go east in Burst Face and not FIRST BASE right away! Also, read the bookshelf again for #17.) Use all the jump commands before getting the grail, and be sure to try the seven dependent point-scoring hub commands first. Also, do not do a dependent point-scoring command until you have gotten all the independent ones in the hub.

This is all possible in theory. But when I tried it I always overlooked something. However, I'll assume that you get all bonus points first time through and get So Slick/Re-Sight-See as well. (Not too bad, clockwise from north in east, clockwise from east in west.) And I'll list what to do once you reach Thor. Perhaps if I revise this document one day I can give a proof of how to get through in two playthroughs.

>NW
Malice Chap, Master Plan, Fellow Yield, Shift Goals, Hunters Grill
>U
Healing Still
>E
Grim Tune

Now we do the warps -- well, 3 of the 4. Then we get all the independent hub points, then INVENTORY. Then get the rest, including the grail. ST when back at Plain Base.

This is the short version. The long version is below. Note that, on trip 1, you can't verify you got achievements with ACH, but they will be recorded. Bonus points (1st trip) and footnotes (2nd) are marked, as well as places you talk for Too Yacky.

=================================

This next time, you'll automatically get Cueing Direct Doing: Correct, since you're unable to get any bonus points this time around, though it won't officially register until the end. Note you don't have to read any of the footnotes to get the footnote achievement.

Okay, we branch from the previous walkthrough here. First, we get everything in the wrong order...

> NW

Examining the runes isn't necessary for footnote 7, but it may help show you what's going on.

Now we can get two independent items, the ones that solve the Grunters' Hill. This saves a bit of time, since otherwise we'd have to try GRIM TUNE before it works, then come back west, then take inventory before using GRIM TUNE successfully.

> E
> FELL SHORT

Now we can sweep the east side.

> U (F8)
> HEALING STILL
> E (F6)
> X RUNES
> XYZZY (F7)
> NW
> GRIM TUNE (achieved Second Revvin' Reckoned? Seven!)

If you type ACH, you'll notice achievements are lumped together by type.

Now, we need to get the remaining independent items.

> I (achieved Hi, All I Haul)

Now we can clear everything else out. But wait! First, let's get the jump achievements! Well, three of them.

> WT (achieved Throw Me Mo': Three)

The point is that some jumps let you go three squares, some two. A spoke from the opposite hub always does the trick.

You can start anywhere for the next bit.

One more jump achievement to get. This one is unwise, but the game catches you.

> SH (achieved Chump, Joke Jump? Choke)

Nope, you can't walk or jump back to Stealing Hill.
