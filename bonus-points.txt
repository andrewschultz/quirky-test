A list of all bonus points, in rough game order (hubs, clockwise in hub side rooms, west then east):

Where you get each is in parentheses, though for 10-16, it can only occur when holding a certain item.

1. TURKEY QUEST (at any time)
2. SHUSH LOUT (only with Pro Boor present)
3. RARE PLIGHTS (only with Player Rights carried)
4-6. BANE PLACE (around Thor)
4-6. THEORY BORE (if you've seen Thor, different reactions if he's around)
4-6. DEATH SENTENCE (anywhere)
7-9. TEST WILES (west tiles)
7-9. BEAST RANCH (east branch)
7-9. RIG BOONS (either hub)
10. SO LONG (low song, E N)
11. VAST FISSION/FISHIN (fast vision, E NE)
12. CEASE PURGING (peace surging, E E)
13. SANE ROLE (rain soul, E SW)
14. GROW NEED (no greed, E W)
15. RACING PASSIONS (pacing rations, W E)
16. I/EYE STAY (My House)
17. TEARY CHIMES (must LISTEN before final bonus point)

14 and 16 were not in the comp release. Instead, at 13-14, there were PILE TRICKS/TRIAL PICS, which you needed the trial pics for. Discovering both now awards the player an achievement.
