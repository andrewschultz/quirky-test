The tutorial is mainly there for people to be acquainted with meta-commands they may not be aware of. There's a puzzle, too, but it's solvable by trial and error.

At first, you are given a way to learn about the game's basics.

> ABOUT

This opens up the THANKS and VERBS commands. They can be done in any order, but the tutorial says to try VERBS first.

> VERBS

This opens up a more meta-verbs.

Here any one of META, THANKS and OPTIONS will get you to the next step of the tutorial.

> THANKS

After this bit, the tutorial says X ME is one of the first commands to use. So why not do so?

> X ME

Hmm! You find something on you. While you know what it is, the tutorial wants you to be comfortable with INVENTORY.

> I

We should now examine what we've gotten.

> X TASK

This provides a clue. The veering choice cheering voice is out there. But what is it saying? The tutorial says, use your senses..

> LISTEN

"Whoa! Guest!"

You may be able to brute-force which way to go, since there are only eight directions.

There is the Rare-Thing-There Ring.
The initial location is Nameless Lameness.
The paper's name is Ooh, Task to Ask.

How would Whoa Guest fit in this?

With GO WEST.

This brings you to the burst face. It's a starting point, but ... well, still a bit more to do.

> FIRST BASE

Now Beery Thor says there is a way out.

> TALK THOR

"Hold, bub," he says. Where is he "protecting" you from?

> BOLD HUB

Now the game opens up a bit.
