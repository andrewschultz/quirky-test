The tutorial is mainly there for people to be acquainted with meta-commands they may not be aware of. There's a puzzle in the spirit of the game, too, but it's solvable by trial and error.

Some of these commands are superfluous in non-tutorial mode.

At first, you are given a way to learn about the game's basics.

> ABOUT

This opens up the THANKS and VERBS commands. They can be done in any order, but the tutorial says to try VERBS first.

> VERBS

This opens up more meta-verbs.

Here any one of META, THANKS and OPTIONS will get you to the next step of the tutorial.

> THANKS

After this bit, the tutorial says X ME is one of the first commands to use. So why not do so?

> X ME

Hmm! You find something on you. While you know what it is, the tutorial wants you to be comfortable with INVENTORY.

> I

We should now examine what we've gotten.

> X TASK

This provides a clue. The veering choice cheering voice is out there. But what is it saying? The tutorial says, use your senses.

> LISTEN

"Whoa! Guest!"

You may be able to brute-force which way to go, since there are only eight directions.

There is the Rare-Thing-There Ring.
The initial location is Nameless Lameness.
The paper's name is Ooh, Task to Ask.

But first, if you are using the tutorial, it will force you to TALK VOICE. The object is to get the player used to talking with other players.

> T VOICE

How would Whoa Guest fit in this?

With ...

> GO WEST (1)

Note you only have to type W or WEST. I could've been nitpicky, but Adventuron's parser is simple, and I wanted people to be able to guess if possible.

This brings you to the burst face. It's a starting point, but ... well, still a bit more to do. There's almost a crack in it. It almost leads somewhere.

> FIRST BASE (1)

Oh no! A Pro Boor!

> BRO POOR (1)

The Pro Boor leaves you with something called Prayer Lights. It has a double meaning, maybe more.

> PLAYER RIGHTS (1)

You've found your way, and it's time to move on. You find the source of the original voice, Beery Thor.

Now the game opens up a bit. You can dispel Seth Denton's, but that is a bonus point. There are others I won't hint at too heavily in this walkthrough.

But as for further progress? It doesn't matter which way you go first, though one way is faster than the other. You will eventually get there either way. The object is to find fifteen spoonerisms that work as follows:

* 8 level 1 spoonerisms
* 4 level 2 spoonerisms, each of which needs 2 level 1 spoonerisms solved first
* 2 level 3 spoonerisms, each of which needs 2 level 2 spoonerisms solved first
* a final level 4 spoonerism, which unlocks the endgame

There are three rooms beyond. East Branch is first if you want to go faster, though it has trickier spoonerisms. West Tiles has easier spoonerisms, but they rely on others.

This provides perhaps not the quickest way to go through things, but quick enough.

> NE

> N

> FLY SCORE (1)

> S

Note that once you solve a spoonerised area, you can't go back. This is hopefully to make progress clearer and help you focus on what you still need to do.

> NE

> BENDING TRUTH (1)

> SW

> E

> BORING WAY (1)

> W

> SE

> DIRT HOME (1)

> NW

> S

> POURING RAIN (1)

> N

> W

> FUNNY MOUNTAIN (1)

> E

This one requires the fly score and roaring pain.

> NW

> GRIM TUNE (1)

> SE

> U

You're done here, so now we'll skip over the hills, which we can't do anything with, yet.

> W

You should now get notification you can jump around with two-word commands. You don't really need to, though.

> E

> FELL SHORT (1)

> W

> S

> TAKE CRACKERS (1)

> N

> SW

This one requires changing the money fountain and warring bay.

> SHIFT GOALS (1)

> NE

> W

This one requires two food items, from the cake trackers and shell fort.

> HUNTERS GRILL (1)

> E

> NW

This requires changing the hurt dome and trending booth.

> FELLOW YIELD (1)

> SE

> N

This requires solving the grunters' hill and the gift shoals.

> MASTER PLAN (1)

> S

> NE

This requires subduing the yellow field and trim goon.

> CHALICE MAP (1)

> SW

Okay, now we have what we need to find what's in the hill!

> U

> HEALING STILL (1)

You won't be allowed back, but you don't need to come back. You're ready for the endgame.

> W

> SE

Or east and southwest.

You're back at the Plain Base, but there's one more exit! Well, if you prepare it. What to do with the travel grail?

> GRAVEL TRAIL (1)

> N

Oh no! A hissing mouse!

> MISSING HOUSE (1)

> N

Glee simmers.

> SEE GLIMMERS (1)

Now how to you reach those glimmers in My House? Perhaps a recently gained friend...

> HI MOUSE (1)

(High mouse works too, since the trunk is high up.)

Congratulations, you win!
