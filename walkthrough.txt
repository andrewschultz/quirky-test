The tutorial is mainly there for people to be acquainted with meta-commands they may not be aware of. There's a puzzle, too, but it's solvable by trial and error.

At first, you are given a way to learn about the game's basics.

> ABOUT

This opens up the THANKS and VERBS commands. They can be done in any order, but the tutorial says to try VERBS first.

> VERBS

This opens up more meta-verbs.

Here any one of META, THANKS and OPTIONS will get you to the next step of the tutorial.

> THANKS

After this bit, the tutorial says X ME is one of the first commands to use. So why not do so?

> X ME

Hmm! You find something on you. While you know what it is, the tutorial wants you to be comfortable with INVENTORY.

> I

We should now examine what we've gotten.

> X TASK

This provides a clue. The veering choice cheering voice is out there. But what is it saying? The tutorial says, use your senses..

> LISTEN

"Whoa! Guest!"

You may be able to brute-force which way to go, since there are only eight directions.

There is the Rare-Thing-There Ring.
The initial location is Nameless Lameness.
The paper's name is Ooh, Task to Ask.

How would Whoa Guest fit in this?

With ...

> GO WEST (1)

Note you only have to type W or WEST. I could've been nitpicky, but Adventuron's parser is simple, and I wanted people to be able to guess if possible.

This brings you to the burst face. It's a starting point, but ... well, still a bit more to do. Thor makes you talk to him.

> TALK THOR

> FIRST BASE (1)

Now Beery Thor says there is a way out, if you TALK to him.

> TALK THOR

"Hold, bub," he says. Where is he "protecting" you from?

> BOLD HUB (1)

Now the game opens up a bit. You can dispel Seth Denton's, but that is a bonus point.

It doesn't matter which way you go first. You will eventually get there. The object is to find fourteen spoonerisms that work as follows:

* 8 level 1 spoonerisms
* 4 level 2 spoonerisms, each of which needs 2 level 1 spoonerisms solved first
* 2 level 3 spoonerisms, each of which needs 2 level 2 spoonerisms solved first
* a final level 4 spoonerism, which unlocks the endgame

There are three rooms beyond. Tricky Quips is first if you want to go faster. It has trickier spoonerisms.

This provides perhaps not the quickest way to go through things, but quick enough.

> N

> FLY SCORE (1)

> S

Note that once you solve a spoonerised area, you can't go back. This is hopefully to make things clearer and remind you what you need to do.

> NE

> BENDING TRUTH (1)

> SW

> E

> BORING WAY (1)

> W

> SE

> DIRT HOME (1)

> NW

> SW

> POURING RAIN (1)

> NE

> W

> FUNNY MOUNTAIN (1)

> E

One thing about going northeast: if you'd gone there right away, you wouldn't have been able to convert. It requires the flaring score and roaring pain.

> NW

> GRIM TUNE (1)

> SE

> U

You can't do anything with the hills yet.

> W

You should now get notification you can jump around. You don't really need to, though.

> E

> FELL SHORT (1)

Fun trivia: this is the only one on the west side you can get by itself.

> W

> SE

> TAKE CRACKERS (1)

> NW

> SW

> SHIFT GOALS (1)

> NE

> W

> HUNTERS GRILL (1)

> E

> NW

> FELLOW YIELD (1)

> SE

> N

> MASTER PLAN (1)

> S

> NE

> CHALICE MAP (1)

> SW

Okay, now we can go up the hill!

> U

> HEALING STILL (1)

Now for the endgame.

> W

Or east.

> S

You're back at the Bold Hub, but there's one more exit! If you prepare it. What to do with the travel grail?

> GRAVEL TRAIL (1)

> N

Oh no! A hissing mouse!

> MISSING HOUSE (1)

> N

Glee simmers.

> SEE GLIMMERS (1)

Now how to you reach those glimmers in My House? Perhaps a recently gained friend...

> HI MOUSE (1)

Congratulations, you win!
