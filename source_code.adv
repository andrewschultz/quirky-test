      "AFGNCAAP is a self-depreciating joke from Zork: Grand Inquisitor, meaning Ageless, Faceless, Gender Neutral, Culturally Ambiguous Adventure Person, to describe you. This was who you were throughout the Zork series.\n\"As good-looking as ever\" is the default response in Inform for {v_x_me}. It's an inside joke among experienced players and programmers that anyone who leaves this in is a bit of a novice, and the rest of the game may be underimplemented.\nIt's a joke I like a lot, because I throw in a lot of AFGNCAAPs and also procrastinate implementing item descriptions. I've never really felt qualified to put forth a protagonist with a strong culture or heritage. Some people interpret this as solipsism. But I see it as not going overboard discussing something I don't understand. Oh, and focusing on the puzzles.",
      "I wanted the initial bit to be an escape-the-room, but I didn't want the verb to be too hard. I was drawing a blank until I thought of Hulk Handsome's game, Go West, which ... well, the title is a bit of a spoiler. Nah, I thought, I couldn't just copy that, and the Village People, and the Pet Shop Boys.\nBut I never thought of anything better, and besides, it made me laugh a bit. Also, Adventuron allowed for different sorts of syntax, so you can just type <W<#f80>>. I do enjoy getting and giving keyboard shortcuts.\nAlso, two links: I encourage you to try <Hulk Handsome<#0f0>>[http://hulkhandsome.itch.io]'s game, <In a Manor of Speaking<#dcb>>[http://hulkhandsome.itch.io/in-a-manor-of-speaking] on itch.io.",
      "It's fun to reward the player for looking into things or even trying to break the game a bit. Here, though, and in the hub, I wanted to restrict movement to places you were done with, so you'd have less \"opportunity\" to wander down a long dead end. That sort of thing can be entertaining for a bit, until it really, really isn't.",
      "The Pro Boor was a late addition. I didn't really have an antagonist, and the original puzzle to get through was {f_first_base} then {f_hold_bub}, which Thor said. This was simple but artificial. But sometimes writing out a placeholder puzzle is the only thing to get you started on something more effective. Or less ineffective. {f_hold_bub} was originally there because you had to reach the Bold Hub, which I split in two after creating, but it felt like it violated the Players' Bill of Rights for making a player do something just to do something. The Bold Hub eventually became Plain Base.\nThe Pro Boor was also originally named the Teen Clown, but I just couldn't quite offer an excuse for why you would wind up in a town or want to leave it. Perhaps this spoonerism pair would've made a good book name in the bookshelf at the end.",
      "I'm proud of Seth Denton's, since the name itself doesn't quite make a spoonerism without the apostrophe, and it doesn't seem particularly ominous.\nOther names that need an apostrophe for a proper spoonerism include Sean Kent's conscience (if you don't pronounce it PRECISELY) and Fran Blake's bran flakes. Well, you can have one bran flake, but many of them as cereal would be more common.\nHearty Pat's came to mind as a store, too. But that's not a proper name.\nI also had ideas for hostile NPCs including Quinn Wick and Trav Hubble, but they were out of scope. I settled for the Pro Boor name-checking Tad Beecher.",
      "I originally based the hub names on the ease of finding spoonerisms. Then I changed the hub names to signs in Plain Base. You may've noticed that everything in West Tiles (formerly Quickie Trips) requires just switching leading letters, while East Branch (formerly Tricky Quips) requires both switching leading letters and changing letters after.\nAfter designing everything to decide which puzzles depended on which others, I also realized that five of West Tiles's puzzles depended on other puzzles, while only one of East Branch did. But I didn't want to uproot a whole game plan just to bring different puzzles together. So I left the quickie trips to be tricky quips in their own way and vice versa. Which actually worked out okay because East Branch has more bonus points (meant to be hard) than West Tiles.\nAlso, recycling the names as signs helped fill the whole graphic for Plain Base.",
      "{v_xyzzy} is a sort of in-joke for parser players and programmers. Some love it and some hate it. <PLUGH<#f80>> and <PLOVER<#f80>> are less common. All summoned a hollow voice saying \"FOOL!\" in the original Adventure. <YOHO<#f80>> is another one, though none of these work in {qt}.\nI didn't want this footnote to be just inside knowledge, though, so I put the big runes in as a puzzle.",
      "I wanted to show the reader some non-reciprocal directions but not have them there just because. The original hub maps were west and east of Thor, and the passage back was south. The hill always had non-reciprocal directions, and it was simpler just to have the side-hubs' exits be diagonal instead of bendy.",
      "Originally, Stealing Hill was called Fate Hill, which works semantically but is too abstract. It sounds wobbly, too, but the temporary name did its job. It lampshaded that it was an important place to be, and it presented the hill as an antagonist, with facial expressions and everything. This might not have happened if I'd gone to Stealing Hill right away.",
      "This was originally the scaring floor, with a flaring score. But it was one of those ideas that felt intermediary. I put my spoonerism finder through both FL/SC and FL/SK flips. Sky floor seems more poetic, and I was worried about the answer being slang, but it really was a short enough word I figured people could guess it even if frustrated. I spent a lot of time looking for something more complex that probably would've been worse.",
      "I was sort of inspired by a combination of Lucy's psychiatrist office and Steven Crowder's disingenuous \"Prove Me Wrong\" table when thinking of this. I have a special, uh, spot in my heart for people who will get up in your business and explain you're very lucky they dropped into your life.",
      "I'm not allergic to excitement, but I don't particularly like being around people who tell my my life needs to be more exciting, and they can help with that. Taking this point to the extreme, there are people who prefer \"exciting\" conflict to \"boring\" peace.\nI try to slip this sort of thing into a lot of what I write, but maybe it is too subtle. Or too obscure.",
      "While I wanted to avoid too-common spoonerisms in {qt}, plaster man/master plan and roaring pain/pouring rain seemed to fit in nicely. So I kept them.",
      "Um, okay, yeah. The Malice Chap, Trim Goon and guy in Yellow Field are ... similar. I think that's what got me the idea to have the puzzles act as a pyramid, with eight needing no prerequisites, four needing stuff from the eight, two needing stuff from the four, and the final one needing the two.",
      "<TAKE CRACKERS<#f80>> is one of my favorite points and drawings in the whole game. Points, because it uses a standard verb. Drawings, because I performed strenuous research on different-shaped crackers. Google Images, you so cool.",
      "Sorry not sorry for the gray mouse spoonerism. I actually didn't see it until I was looking for excuses to add footnotes. I wish I had found more of this sort of thing. I think one reason I backloaded them (the key, the trunk) is because I'd gotten to the end and hadn't had the chance to fire off nonsequiturs like that. (Achievement names don't count.)\nMaybe I'll look through my notes to find a bit more. Maintenance releases/post-comp releases aren't just for bug fixes!",
      "I enjoy seeing and implementing random stuff you can just sift through if you want, pushing the up-arrow to repeat a command for random text. Often when I write games I have ideas that would seem forced as part of the solution, but they are too good not to share somehow. I've used books before and probably will again.\nOne of the first things that made me say \"wow\" about Inform 7 was the <one of/or/in random order<#ff0>> construction. Adventuron has it, too, and it's as easy and intuitive, but with more formal code."
