# Quirky Test (2025 Text Adventure Literacy Jam entrant)

This is a repository for the Adventuron source code for Quirky Test, which was entered in the 2025 Text Adventure Literacy Jam (TALJ), formerly TALP. The initial release date was April 30, 2025.

It is a wordplay game with a tutorial, but it also has an NPC who discusses what people can expect from a parser game. It features bonus points, achievements, and (once the player finished) footnotes.

There is a post-comp release planned. It adds more achievements.

In-comp I am only planning to shuffle achievements and maybe track bonus points so the player has more chance to find or organize them
