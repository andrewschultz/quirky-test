# Quirky Test (2025 Text Adventure Literacy Jam entrant)

This is a repository for the Adventuron source code for Quirky Test, which was entered in the 2025 Text Adventure Literacy Jam (TALJ), formerly TALP. The initial release date was April 30, 2025. It placed 4th of 7 entries.

It is a wordplay game with a tutorial, but it also has an NPC who discusses what people can expect from a parser game. It features bonus points, achievements, and (once the player finished) footnotes. I'd like to think that the tutorial encompasses, first, the conveniences to expect from a modern parser now that programmers can use more memory, and second, what a player can expect in terms of a game's fairness.

I'd like to put in an ad here for TALP/TALJ. It's a great way to learn a programming language and also to describe or show what you learned or know.

A post-comp release is scheduled for June 2025. It adds more achievements, fixes bugs, tweaks graphics and has many under-the-hood changes so the source is easy to peruse for future Adventuron programmers.
