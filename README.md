# Quirky Test (2025 Text Adventure Literacy Jam entrant)

This is a repository for the Adventuron source code for *Quirky Test*, which was entered in the [2025 Text Adventure Literacy Jam (TALJ), formerly TALP](https://itch.io/jam/talp2025). The initial release date was April 30, 2025. It placed 4th of 7 entries. A runnable web version of the game is [here](https://andrewschultz.itch.io/quirky-test), with a downloadable HTML file.

*Quirky Test* is a wordplay game with a tutorial and graphics, but it also has an NPC who discusses what people can expect from a parser game. It features bonus points, achievements, and (once the player finished) footnotes. I'd like to think that the tutorial encompasses, first, the conveniences to expect from a modern parser now that programmers can use more memory, and second, what a player can expect in terms of a game's fairness.

There are twenty-three rooms, but fourteen of them are "guess what to do and leave" and spokes in a hub. So I hope it is not too overwhelming.

The walkthrough.txt file will guide you through how to get all the bonus points and footnotes. There are seventeen of each. I imagine that should be enough for most players.

The achievements are optional and are meant to be a bit tricky. It's possible to get them all in two trips through, but I have to admit, the effort wasn't trivial for me to organize things, and I programmed the game!

If you want to, you can see the way through in achievements.txt.

There have been post-comp releases, mainly where I tried to experiment with Adventuron to make gameplay smoother, or add fun features. For the original release, I never considered an in-game map or even the "G" command to go to the likely next best place, but since the game wasn't too big, I enjoyed the exercise of implementing it.

There may be future releases for minor features, but I can't see much at the moment, beyond updating the Easter Egg endgame, which contains references to works I've written.

Previous release dates are listed below.

2.1.1: 2028/8/4, G command for going intelligently to where you can progress
2.1.0: 2028/7/30, MAP command for in-game graphic map
2.0.2: 2028/7/25, THINK command clarification and better player cueing
2.0.1: 2028/7/18, new item near the end that you can onlock, which helps you find achievements
2.0.0: 2028/7/5, remaking with more achievements, an Easter Egg command (noticing something in the graphics and game requirements,) and many bug fixes
1.0.0: 2025/4/30

I'd like to put in an ad here for TALP/TALJ. It's a great way to learn a programming language and also to describe or show what you learned or know. Here are past editions:

Oh, hey! One other thing. If you wish to read all the book titles in the bookshelf without replaying, search for the text START RANDOM BOOKS HERE in source_code.adv. This isn't a huge spoiler, as the bookshelf is just intended as comic relief once you've almost won the game.
